# MonoDAC

This project aims to build a system that takes a single RGB image as input, and
outputs a depth map corresponding to that image. Each pixel on the depth map will be an
RGB value with each colour channel varying according to the predicted depth, closer
being brighter. Each one of these pixels will correspond to the same pixel in the input
image.

In order to accomplish the task of depth map generation, the project will utilise
high performance neural networks, trained over vast RGB-Depth pairs.
